system_prompt = """A conversation between User and Assistant. The user asks a question, and the Assistant solves it.
The assistant first thinks about the reasoning process in the mind and then provides the user
with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and
<answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think>
<answer> answer here </answer>.

Do not generate new code. Do not write python code.

You may also be given examples by the user telling you the expected response format.
Follow the format of the examples, but solve the specific problem asked by the user, not the examples.

Very important - Remember again, your output format should be:
<think> reasoning process here </think>
<answer> answer here </answer>

Your response will be scored by extracting the substring between the <answer>...</answer> tags.
It is critical to follow the above format.
feature_extraction_utilsling to follow the response format will result in a penalty.
